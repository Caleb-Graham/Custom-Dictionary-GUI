# Custom-Dictionary-GUI
Allows users to create their own dictionary to help remember difficult words or to expand their vocabulary

This project allows users to look up definitions to words like a normal dictionary. It then gives you the option to store those definitions into your custom database so you can keep track of the definitions you have looked up.
This will allow people to memorize words faster.

This application connects to twinword API which is where it gets its definitions. It also creates a Graphical User Interface for the user using tkinter.
Then it stores and deletes definitions using SQLite, a built in database for Python.

It is a short and simple program the effectively serves its purpose.
